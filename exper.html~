    Remote Adaptable Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (RAPIDS) 
  </div>
  <div id="rt" class="txt">
    Our team was responsible for the video sensors, video processing video object detection, video object classification using sophisticated Bayesian Networks, and tracking. We also provide overall command and control and the operator GUI. The system successfully demonstrated the core capabilities of intrusion detection, tracking, and classification on intruder scenarios conducted at Bellow's Air Force Base. The RAPIDS program was a collaboration between four Hawaiian leading technology developers; Advanced Fusion Technologies (AFT), Concentris Systems, Oceanit and Pukoa Scientific.

   Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance (ARCHER)
  </div>
  <div id="rt" class="txt">
   Our team was responsible for the ARCHER airborne and ground based processing systems as well as initial test and demonstration software. The airborne processor is based on a highly ruggedized PC architecture with shock and vibration mounted high speed hard disks. A high-powered DSP coprocessor was deployed to provide real-time airborne hyperspectral processing capability. The demonstration code consisted of a C# user interface that interfaced to optimized C and DSP C code for the hyperspectral processing. ARCHER is an aerial imaging system that produces ground images far more detailed than plain sight or ordinary aerial photography can as well as providing the most sophisticated unclassified hyperspectral imaging system available, according to U.S. Government officials.[2] ARCHER can automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the object being sought (such as a missing aircraft),[3] for abnormalities in the surrounding area, or for changes from previous recorded spectral signatures.[4] It has direct applications for search and rescue, counterdrug, disaster relief and impact assessment, and homeland security, and has been deployed by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in the United States on the Australian built Gippsland GA8 Airvan fixed-wing aircraft.[2]

  Advanced Mobile Targeting
  </div>
  <div id="rt" class="txt">
  Advanced Mobile Targeting was a multi-year program to develop advanced autonomous search, detection, classification, and tracking algorithms using imaging sensors for deployment on UAVs using both real imagery and simulated UAV engagements (using high fidelity simulated imagery and UAV flight models).   A patent was awarded based on the technologies developed under this program.
