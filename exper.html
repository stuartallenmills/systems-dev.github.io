  <div id="rt" class="blktxt">
The Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance, also known by the acronym ARCHER, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_Real-time_Cueing_Hyperspectral_Enhanced_Reconnaissance">( see wikipedia)</a> is an aerial imaging system that produces ground images far more detailed than plain sight or ordinary aerial photography can. It is the most sophisticated unclassified hyperspectral imaging system available, according to U.S. Government officials. ARCHER can automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the object being sought (such as a missing aircraft), for abnormalities in the surrounding area, or for changes from previous recorded spectral signatures.
<p>
It has direct applications for search and rescue, counterdrug, disaster relief and impact assessment, and homeland security, and has been deployed by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in the United States on the Australian built Gippsland GA8 Airvan fixed-wing aircraft. CAP, the civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force, is a volunteer education and public service non-profit organization that conducts aircraft search and rescue in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
The ARCHER processor was comprised of a ruggedized Windows PC and dedicated real-time multi-processor DSP hardware implemented via a plug-in PCI card.  The Windows User Interface was written in C# while the hypersprectal image processing, primarily deployed on the DSP, was written in C/C++.

  <div id="rt" class="blktxt">
 The Real-Time Processor Navy’s Real-Time Processor which was developed for real-time exploitation of high-resolution hyper-spectral imagery in a military environment. It was a VxWorks system, comprised of 12 VME cards, 8 of which had 4 DSP processors each, for a total of 32 DSPs, communicating over a proprietary high speed bus. Obtaining optimal performance required careful distribution of the tasks amongst the processors taking into account bandwidth issues, and with particular need to ensure that cache thrashing was minimized. The RTP was flown by the Navy and demonstrated real time detection performance.  Responsibilities included System requirements, hardware design and software design, as well as detailed software engineering for the multi-processor DSP subsystem (‘C’ language).   UML was used to capture design elements at both the system level and detail software level.
